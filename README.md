### MLCollage

ML Collage is a mac-based app that allows users to generate high volumes of novel data given a small sample input. 
When training ml vision models, often it can be tough to collect the (likely) thousands of sample photos needed to effectively train 
to a high degree of accuracy. That's where MLCollage comes in. This app allows the generation of many 'novel' photos of the subject by 
essentaly cut-and-pasting the pre-existing photos into new arrangements. Stop wasting your time on the tedium of data collection! Dowload
ML Collage and train your vison model _fast_.
